# react-native-obd2
React-native OBD-II reader designed to connect with Bluetooth Elm327 OBD reader. This project is inspired from [android-obd-reader]( https://github.com/pires/android-obd-reader) so that we wrapped the OBD Java API in order to use in react-native world.

# How to install
Run below link on your project root folder.
````
$ npm install @furkanom/react-native-obd2 --save
$ react-native link
````

# For version compatibility
You can edit this block to your own project and put it at the bottom of the **android/build.gradle**
````
subprojects {
    afterEvaluate {project ->
        if (project.hasProperty("android")) {
            android {
                compileSdkVersion rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion
                buildToolsVersion rootProject.ext.buildToolsVersion
            }
        }
    }
}
````

# APIs
## ready()
This method will check a bluetooth status and prepare to use it.
````
const obd2 = require('@furkanom/react-native-obd2');
...
obd2.ready();
````

## getBluetoothDeviceNameList
This method brings available bluetooth device information including name and address. The result is array type of maps which consist of "name" and "address".
### Example
````
const obd2 = require('@furkanom/react-native-obd2');
...
obd2.getBluetoothDeviceNameList()
     .then((nameList) => console.log('Bluetooth device list : ' + JSON.stringify(nameList)))
      .catch((e) => console.log('Get device name error : ' + e)));
````

### Output
````
Bluetooth device list: [{name: "OBD-II", address: "10 F0 8B 3F 91"}]
````

## setMockUpMode(enabled)
react-native-obd2 provides mock up mode so that you can simply check your apps without connecting real bluetooth device as android-obd-reader did. Default value is 'false'. Therefore, react-native-obd2 will work in real mode if you do not use this method.

## startLiveData(btDeviceAddress)
Do work! do!
The data is flow to your listeners. Therfore you have to set your listenr named 'obd2LiveData'.

### Example
````
const obd2 = require('@furkanom/react-native-obd2');
...
  componentDidMount() {
    this.obdLiveDataListener = DeviceEventEmitter.addListener('obd2LiveData', this.obdLiveData);
    obd2.startLiveData('10 F0 8B 3F 91');
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.obdStatusListener.remove();
  }
````

## stopLiveData()
Hey stop it!

## Listeners
### 'obd2bluetoothStatus'
for getting bluetooth device status.

JSON key | Type | Description
---------|------|----------------
status   |String|'connected' or 'disconnected' or 'error' or 'disable' or 'ready' or 'connecting'

### 'obd2Status'
for getting OBD-II device status

JSON key | Type | Description
---------|------|----------------
status   |String|'disconnected' or 'receiving' or OBD data result

### 'obd2LiveData'
for getting OBD-II data. Data structure is a dictionary as below.

````
{
   'cmdID' : String,
   'cmdName' : String,
   'cmdResult' : String
}
````

## Example
We also provide simple working example in Example folder. We hope it would be helpful for you.
